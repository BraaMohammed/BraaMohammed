### Full-Stack Developer specializing in building scalable SaaS applications from concept to deployment.

I'm a self-taught developer from Egypt with a passion for building user-centric products. With a background in Civil Engineering, I bring a structured, problem-solving approach to software development. I have 1.5 years of hands-on experience architecting and launching two complete SaaS applications: a B2B video outreach platform and a B2C productivity tool.

**I'm currently seeking a full-time remote role where I can contribute to a product-driven team.**
